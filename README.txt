Update input function to change first line of text file to read as height * width instead of width * height

- apply A* algorithm to each tree to get the optimal path for each robot to get to
  the rendezvous point from each one's starting point
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Done:
- input handling
- input parsing to save values from text file into usable variables for use in
  program
- straight line distance from current to rendezvous point heuristic
